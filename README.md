The Finance Tracker app provides small business owners with a powerful yet intuitive way to monitor their financial health. The tab-based interface makes navigation straightforward with dedicated sections for dashboard, transactions, adding new entries, and financial reports.
The app includes convenient voice input and receipt scanning capabilities to make expense tracking effortless for busy traders. The dashboard provides at-a-glance financial information showing income, expenses, and profit, while the transactions screen allows for easy filtering and searching of past entries.
